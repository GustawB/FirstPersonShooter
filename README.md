# FirstPersonShooter

This is my unsuccessful attempt to make a pseudo sim-shooter. Of course, I failed, but I managed to make:
-shooting mechanics (that means spawning bullets with different speeds depending on the weapon)
-two guns (with different ammo types, fire rate and projectile speed)
-two ammo types (for two weapon types)
-aiming (you press the button, something similar to aiming happens)
-equipment system (you can store different types of ammo)
-ammo boxes (you can pick them by pressing 'E' near them)
-reloading (press 'R')
-weapon picking/changing (press 'E' near weapon)
-two gamemodes (activated by pressing 'E' near cubes with strange meshes. Gamemodes actually work(kinda), one is time-based and the other one is ammo-based, both gamemodes can tell you how many scores you've got and what was your longest shoot)
-targets for gamemodes
-I don't remember anything else (it's been months since I decided to abandon this project)


Developed with Unreal Engine 4
Licences: I'm not into legal stuff, so as long as you don't publish this as your work feel free to do anything with it (but keep in mind, this project is kinda unreadable at its current state, so good luck).
